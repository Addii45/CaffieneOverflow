The platform aims at solving the problem of optimal resource utilization. It provides flexibility for almost any user to put their unused products on rent and get paid. While on the other hand, it allows any user to borrow any product instead of investing a high amount in buying them. It solves the shortcomings of a centralized B2C marketplace such as not allowing users to rent their products or complete governance of a single party and transparency.\nSpecifications:\nDispute Resolving Mechanism: For such a marketplace, involving no middleman, a mechanism to govern and resolve disputes with fund management is required. Drent provides a mechanism for users to create a dispute upon an existing order and by the wisdom of crowds principle, users of the platform collectively vote and help in resolution. Hence no central parties can manipulate decisions. The voters stake an economic value in the platform which is locked in a contract and upon crowdsourced decision, results are declared and stakes (with rewards to winners) are released.\nThe platform maintains a reputation based on the events performed, which in turn benefits while paying the collateral amount.\nIn conjunction, the platform offers\nLightning-fast transactions powered by Matic Network.\nGasless Meta Transactions powered by Biconomy.\nDistributed storage powered by IPFS.\nInterest generation on tokens powered by Aave Protocol (partially implemented).", ,"[""Solidity"",""IPFS"",""ethers.js"",""Matic"",""MongoDB"",""Nodejs"",""Truffle Suite"",""React.""]","{""Category"":""science and research"",""average predictions"":0.443389}",science and research

Nowadays, drunk driving causes road accidents every now and then across the world. So, these activities should be required to automatically handle an implementation of smart alert system or vigilance in a vehicle which is an objective of this system. So the system we came up with is Anti Drunk Car Alert System.\nA high-sensitivity alcohol sensor is built near the steering, used in non contact mode the sensor is fixed at certain distance from the driver.Which is able to detect the presence of alcohol as he or she attempts to start driving. When the alcohol-level detected is above the pre-determined threshold, the system automatically locks the transmission, immobilizing the car.\nThereby minimizing the chances of any mishaps that can happen, this project presents a way to avoid drunk and drive accidents.\nWe made our product more efficient which means better than existing one and while components ,there are around 2-3 different featured components so selecting them and checking which one is better and which combination gives our product best is the biggest complication.

For time immemorial women in general have been forced to occupy a secondary place in relation to men. Women have been relegated to the margins in spite of the fact that they are numerically half of the world's population. \nAccording to the World Bank:\nWomen account for 66% of the world’s working hours but only 10% of the world income.\nOf the 900 million adults worldwide who cannot read or write, about two thirds are women.\nMany women leave their jobs to tend to their familial needs. They are currently under-represented in STEM-related professions.\nIt is also believed that women will be disproportionately affected by digital transformation.\nWomen 11 times more likely to not work after Covid job loss\nA change can be brought through the constitution and supportive legislations. The Constitution of India gives a women status equal to men. Women empowerment has to begin with women's active participation. Unless women throw off the shackles that ignore their talent, skill and spirit women through education and economic self-reliance, women cannot be empowered.\nAccording to READ GLOBAL one of the key enablers for women empowerment is the need for a “safe space” for women to gather and learn. However, as of now there is no such virtual platform available. The next enabler for women empowerment is to teach women job skills and seed businesses. There is also a need to build their self-esteem and confidence. With EMPOWER we propose a platform for women to build, grow and learn together. We aim to create communities of women that support each other along with the skill enhancement and upliftment provided to them by NGOs on the platform. We aim to curate a platform where women can connect, share their thoughts, promote their businesses, connect with potential recruiters and get quick replies to common questions through conversational AI.",Top 12,"[""jQuery"",""Bootstrap"",""Node.js"",""Socket.IO"",""MongoDB Atlas"",""ejs"",""Tensorflowjs"",""Google OAuth2"",""Google DialogFlow"",""IBM Watson Cloud""]","{""Category"":""mental health"",""average predictions"":0.223654}",mental health

Majority of Indian Population is dependent on agriculture as the source of their livelihood. However, there are several problems faced by the farmers which are as follows:-\n● Farmers are hardly benefited from the prices they receive for their crops.Agriculture marketing is in a very bad shape in rural India. Due to absence of proper marketplaces,farmers are not able to sell their crops at a reasonable price. \n● These farmers have to depend upon local traders and middlemen who take unfair advantage over farmers due to lack of storage facilities.They buy crops at a very cheap rate from farmers and sell at a high price to the consumers.\n● Lack of good quality seeds,irrigation facilities and high production costs, leads to the farmers taking large loans and often falling into debt.\nTo eliminate the above stated problems and provide relief to the farmers, we have come up with an idea to create an app that will possibly eradicate the involvement of middlemen and local traders. \nAlthough certain apps and technologies are already present to solve these problems, our app differs from them and can be a great upgrade on them. The various unique functionalities provided by our app are as follows:-\n#Interface for the farmers:-\n● All the farmers registered in the app can put up their crops for sale with their prices and quantity available. All the crops put up by different farmers will be visible to every customer for buying the same. Through this, the individual farmers can get a reasonable price for their crops by directly selling to the customers. \n● Separate accounts for each farmer which shows the total sales for their crops.\n● A farmer can form a group or cooperative that will work collectively to sell their crops and remove any involvement of these middlemen and local traders.", ,"[""Java"",""Android Studio"",""XML"",""Adobe XD"",""Google Firebase""]","{""Category"":""general wellfare"",""average predictions"":0.453981}",general wellfare

There are two purposes for competitive exams; at school and college, they encourage students to study by rewarding those who demonstrate the will to learn with reputation, prizes, admissions to universities and scholarships. They're also used in the selection of military and civil service officers. This makes success in these exams very lucrative, attracting many students.\nHowever the archaic education system makes the preparation process very tedious, boring and unintuitive. This leads to burnout and a general disinterest towards academics. This system is also inefficient as it doesn’t have room for a dynamic system of preparation. Another issue that presented itself in the current, unprecedented times is that education has to evolve beyond brick and mortar institutions to function and thrive. The sudden rise in solutions implementing technology into education is no coincidence. As we are forced to look for alternatives to conventional learning methods, we have to find efficient and innovative methods so as to keep improving the quality of education.\nWe decided to create an innovative solution to help students prepare for their exams using ExamTantra. ExamTantra’s goal is to “Gamify” the mundane tasks of attempting exams by adding elements such as peer attempts: solving papers with peers resulting in a more productive practice environment, leaderboards to compare progress, a clean minimal UI so as to not distract the user, badges, awards and other reinforcements which have been proven to be psychological motivators.

Although journaling has its own merits but to top it all, our web app gives users a personalised emotional spa experience - where the massage is positivity, the scrub to remove dead cells is powerful words and in the end we shower them with positive affirmation!\nOur web app allows users to express their day by typing their feelings over a digital canvas which in turn attempts to analyse their sentiments using an ML model to give them what they really need.

In such times the use of technology has increased tremendously for communication and daily-life activities.\nOur goal is to make it easy for 70 million deaf people across the world to be independent of translators for there daily communication needs, so we designed this model so that we can use it in some applications to make persons with disability independent of translators.

We can aslo display ads instead of recommendations.\nTo track the user’s scroll behavior, we use Javascript. The JavaScript detects the scrolling activity. It also creates a div with an id which is used to display the data present on the screen.

By building Treasur, we aim to give creators the opportunity to unlock revenue of their content which they put in so much effort for. YouTube undercuts creators by charging exorbitant fees on ad revenue and channel memberships (30% for the latter, as of now). We aim to provide a way for creators to be able to give their content at whatever price they are comfortable with, as collectibles for subscribers to own and trade. This means that we can finally provide a decentralized solution over and above the current monetization capabilities of a centralizated structure. Finally, by having an existing marketplace with sufficient liquidity, it can be a revenue stream for the vast number of creators that are underfunded on YouTube, by attaching creator fees and resale value to NFTs.

UTXOs can be attributed ownership based on economic activity patterns, lack of privacy controls, and a false understanding of how UTXOs are processed in a bitcoin transaction.\nFor those that wish to retain a higher level of privacy, solutions such as multisignature, CoinSwap, CoinJoin, and Payjoin exist -- but are not easily accessible to the common user, as most of these solutions require in-depth technical knowledge of the Bitcoin protocol and administration of infrastructure that can sync and store and maintain chain data. An additional knowledge set of how to construct, parse, and sign partially signed bitcoin transaction (PSBT) data is required for enhanced privacy features.

Due to unintended tremors in their arms, patients are unable to perform everyday menial tasks like eating food out of a bowl with a spoon.\nThe stabilizing spoon compensates for unintended tremors or shivers received from the user and calibrates its head against these forces, thus keeping the spoon bowl stable at all times. This spoon can move as quickly as 500°/second, hence effectively steadying the spoon and easing the eating process of patients.\nAnother part of the holistic product is a mobile application for a designated doctor to monitor the patient’s progress.\nDuring this pandemic, people have been terrified of entering hospitals for non-COVID diseases and ailments, and we aim to create and market a product to help people adjust better to this new norm.\nWe have developed an application that analyses data collected from the spoon via sensors and statistically displays it to the designated doctor.

So, we decided to create a game that utilizes web3 technologies as much as possible for our project and create services like real-time chat, game rooms, player profiles that can be used by other games. These services are very common among modern online multiplayer games and we need a reliable and scalable alternative that uses a web3 tech stack. So, we have decided to create a game that incorporates all these features.\nWhat it does\nWe have built a blockchain incentivized online multiplayer mafia party Game.\n1. We maintain the game history of a player as an NFT.\n2. When you sign up, your profile is minted as an NFT and stored as a textile bucket with an IPNS link and you will also get some CMC(Crypto Mafia Coin) which is our in-game currency as a registration bonus.\n3. When you sign in, your profile will be retrieved from the IPFS and it will be used to generate your unique avatar from the hash of your token_id.\n4. There are 2 game modes: 1) casual game - which is just normal gameplay, 2) competitive game - In this, you will be staking your coin and can win/lose the coins.\n5. You can create a new room or join an existing room.\n6. In the Game we have Mafia, Doctor, Detective, and Villagers, the aim is for either Mafia to kill everyone else or for Villagers to find all Mafia and eject them from the game during the voting phase. The doctor can choose to save a player from being killed every night while the detective can inspect the role of a player during the night.\n7. You can chat in-game with fellow players and decide who to vote on!\n8. The winning party will get all staked coins and distribute them equally among themselves with a small fee deducted from the stack so that we can maintain game servers smoothly", ,"[""Solidity"",""IPFS"",""React"",""Matic"",""Express.js"",""Textile.io"",""Chainlink"",""Truffle Suite""]","{""Category"":""miscellaneous "",""average predictions"":0.238263}",miscellaneous

Whether it's studies, food ordering or jobs we all faced several challenges and the only help to us during this time was the internet. Whether we agree or not, the world is moving towards digitalization at a very rapid rate. Several services are getting digitalized. Thinking about the same we came up with an idea of why we can’t make our railway journeys much more easier, especially that part of the journey off the train. Think of how clumsy it gets when you're carrying huge luggages and searching for coolies everywhere in the station and then bargaining with them. The idea of our project is to save time and efforts for you by finding a coolie. You can now book your coolie before you even reach the station. If you are a patient or with disability you need not worry. We have got a service to book wheelchairs at railway stations which will be made ready for you before your arrival. On the other hand, this app benefits coolies and gets customers to them through one click of a button who otherwise had to literally run beside passengers to get a pickup. Currently the realization of the idea only contains baggage pickup and wheelchair services. But the idea doesn't stop here, in future we also think to add more services for both the users and coolie, using which they can benefit a lot.\nWith digitalization and the stablishment of free wifi and services at railway stations, we are moving towards the path of hightech railways stations. The availablity of 24/7 internet facility makes the task for the coolie easier. They just need a smartphone availability and they are all set to operate the services provided by the app. Looking at many ongoing services outside the railway stations like Swiggy, Zomato, Urban Clap, Uber, and Ola we feel that someday it's possible to get a facility like these into the stations as well.", ,"[""Firebase"",""Android Studio"",""Python"",""FastAPI""]","{""Category"":""miscellaneous "",""average predictions"":0.489563}",miscellaneous

Clinica,Clinica tackles the problem of a weak supply chain using AI and bridges the poor distinction between the price of branded and generic medicines by building a specific platform for selling medicines.,https://devfolio.co/submissions/clinica-e4f7,"[""https://shrouded-basin-46770.herokuapp.com/"",""https://github.com/404Enigma/Sociothon-Hackathon-2021"",""https://healthapi1.herokuapp.com/[month]/[category]""]","The problem Clinica solves\nTo tackle the problem of a weak supply chain, Clinica uses a machine-learning algorithm which is used to predict the sales of the drugs for the current month by calling out a private API made by us which basically consists of a machine learning algorithm. So, the algorithm's main task is to identify the relationship between the sales of the drugs of previous years considering data back from 2014 to the present month in the field of pharmaceutical. After predicting the sales of the current month, it is used by the vendor to predict the amount of stock needed by him for that particular month. It then helps in building a strong supply chain system by directly keeping in contact with the supplier and the vendor. Clinica also has a feature named ""Emergency Need of Stock"" which is available to the vendor in case of need of emergency stock. It can be used when there is a sudden increase in the demand for a particular drug which forces the supplier to increase the supply of that respective drug to avoid the sudden break in the supply chain system. Using Clinica, one can predict the sales of the future too using our API. By predicting the sales of the current month, our system surpasses the problem of the supply chain system.\nSecondly, to tackle the problem of the poor distinction between the branded and the generic medicines, Clinica has a platform for its customers to know about what are generic medicines and how they are different from branded medicines in terms of price and quantity. A platform built to let know its customers about the generic medicines provided under JAS and where a customer has a choice to add a particular medicine to its cart of future references. Our platform is a positive means to spread awareness of the ongoing Govt. scheme. People of don't know the variation of prices in the medicines, our platform shows the same before the eyes of the customer so that they can choose wisely and buy the much better deal.", ,"[""Node.js"",""JavaScript"",""Flask"",""scikit-learn"",""NumPy"",""pandas"",""expressjs"",""Google Authentication"",""Firebase Cloud Firestore"",""HTML5 CSS3""]","{""Category"":""mental health"",""average predictions"":0.25839}",mental health

Due to unintended tremors in their arms, patients are unable to perform everyday menial tasks like eating food out of a bowl with a spoon.\nThe stabilizing spoon compensates for unintended tremors or shivers received from the user and calibrates its head against these forces, thus keeping the spoon bowl stable at all times. This spoon can move as quickly as 500°/second, hence effectively steadying the spoon and easing the eating process of patients.\nAnother part of the holistic product is a mobile application for a designated doctor to monitor the patient’s progress. \nDuring this pandemic, people have been terrified of entering hospitals for non-COVID diseases and ailments, and we aim to create and market a product to help people adjust better to this new norm.\nWe have developed an application that analyses data collected from the spoon via sensors and statistically displays it to the designated doctor. By using this application, a doctor can not only monitor your progress but also offer diagnosis and treatment remotely, without the patient needing to leave their home.\nWith this project, the absolute aim is to make a product that can make a patient’s life easier.\nThe product will not only make it easy for the user to eat food out of a plate/bowl but also help their recovery by enabling inexpensive and thorough communication with a designated doctor.\nIn an age where people are petrified of the thought of entering the premises of a hospital, we are trying to use all the technical experience we have to create an experience that avoids as much physical contact as possible.\nIn the case of neuro diseases associated with nerves and muscles, it is imperative for the doctor to check up on the patient’s movements regularly, but we have attempted to find a way for doing that without requiring the patient to ever enter a hospital.",Runner-up(2nd place),"[""Firebase"",""Java"",""Internet of Things (IoT)"",""NodeMCU"",""Kotlin"",""Arduino"",""Android NDK"",""Sensors""]","{""Category"":""health and wellness"",""average predictions"":0.769279}",health and wellness

Whether it's studies, food ordering or jobs we all faced several challenges and the only help to us during this time was the internet. Whether we agree or not, the world is moving towards digitalization at a very rapid rate. Several services are getting digitalized. Thinking about the same we came up with an idea of why we can’t make our railway journeys much more easier, especially that part of the journey off the train. Think of how clumsy it gets when you're carrying huge luggages and searching for coolies everywhere in the station and then bargaining with them. The idea of our project is to save time and efforts for you by finding a coolie. You can now book your coolie before you even reach the station. If you are a patient or with disability you need not worry. We have got a service to book wheelchairs at railway stations which will be made ready for you before your arrival. On the other hand, this app benefits coolies and gets customers to them through one click of a button who otherwise had to literally run beside passengers to get a pickup. Currently the realization of the idea only contains baggage pickup and wheelchair services. But the idea doesn't stop here, in future we also think to add more services for both the users and coolie, using which they can benefit a lot.\nWith digitalization and the stablishment of free wifi and services at railway stations, we are moving towards the path of hightech railways stations. The availablity of 24/7 internet facility makes the task for the coolie easier. They just need a smartphone availability and they are all set to operate the services provided by the app. Looking at many ongoing services outside the railway stations like Swiggy, Zomato, Urban Clap, Uber, and Ola we feel that someday it's possible to get a facility like these into the stations as well.", ,"[""Firebase"",""Android Studio"",""FAST API""]","{""Category"":""miscellaneous "",""average predictions"":0.492732}",miscellaneous

For example, imagine we are at a construction site where the ground floor reinforcement is being laid. Today all that information that the steel fixer needs is (generally) stored in a set of A1 drawings in the site office. These drawings have been pulled from a BIM model and then edited to adhere to a set of drawing standards that are understandable to the human eye. I know from my drafting days that this means that much of the information in the model is lost when it is transferred to a 2D drawing. It makes no sense to develop a digital model, filled with useful information that can improve safety, scheduling, project management processes and quality; and then we strip all that information out, simple because we have no better way. But it has to be done, because what’s the alternative?\nAt this time there is no practical way to make this model and all its information available to those who need it.\nResearch shows, that by giving a worker task-specific information he is better informed, and less distracted by other information, improving the quality of his work and reducing the chance of errors. In addition to this, many specialised workers only attend the site for a short period of time and then leave, meaning they have no understanding of the overall project context. By providing them with on-demand, context-aware information, they are empowered to make better decisions and improve efficiency.\nIt has also been proven that AR has the ability to implement BIM in such a way that information is more easily retrieved, reducing errors during assembly, communication improvements and problem solving improvements.", ,"[""C++"",""Augmented Reality"",""Blender"",""C#"",""Unity 3D""]","{""Category"":""general wellfare"",""average predictions"":0.262265}",general wellfare

So, what if we can track the scrolling behaviour, understand where they stop and recommend based on that.\nMost of the user's time goes wasted in scrolling content that he/she isn’t interested in. To understand their interest, their scrolling behaviour can be tracked. Point where they stop scrolling and spend some time viewing the content shows that they are interested in that content. So, our idea is to retrieve the products when scrolling stops, get similar products to that using ML techniques and display that at their point of scroll. We can aslo display ads instead of recommendations.\nTo track the user’s scroll behavior, we use Javascript. The JavaScript detects the scrolling activity. It also creates a div with an id which is used to display the data present on the screen. Once, the user stops scrolling, we extract the product present in that div tag and send it to the recommendation system.

They’re overwhelmed by the sheer number of things that need to be done, all the people that need help, and all the worthy causes that exist. However, lots of individuals making small efforts can change the world.\nHere is an opportunity for everyone to give and receive blessings.\nFirstly, We are working on an initiative of ""Street Food Box"". In this, You can drop your left-out food at our installed boxes at respective stations. This collected food will be passed on to poor and homeless people. We have seen many people craving food and dying on the streets. So we felt like we should help them with our technology and devices because why not.\nIn our personal lives, many of the times we're stuck in a situation where we have leftover food items and you have to throw them unnecessarily.\nSo we tried to take a step to solve this.\nBasically, our idea is that we want to install a system over some possible public places.\nA system in which there's a refrigerator fitted to store the food. You can navigate the nearest systems/boxes present through this site and can put your leftover food into it. Our members will take out that food from the respective systems and give the edible checked food to the people who're dying of hunger.\nSecondly, We are working on Donating school supplies that will help poor students in their education without worrying about their financial conditions. This will surely motivate them to learn new skills and enhance their knowledge.\nFinally, we have a separate page for You to share your experiences and stories with us where you helped someone in need.", ,"[""jQuery"",""Bootstrap"",""CSS"",""JavaScript"",""HTML5""]","{""Category"":""mental health"",""average predictions"":0.180173}",mental health

This project aims to solve this issue by batching users who wish to perform same token swaps. Instead of each user doing individual swap, a bunch of users are grouped together, their tokens are added together, the total sum of tokens are swapped in a single transaction and finally the swapped token is distributed to the users based on their initial share. \nThis is acheived by using a layer 2 ""pessimistic"" rollup which acts as a ""super wallet"" for the users. The rollup keeps track of the individual deposits and performs swap when a sufficient number of users are available. By doing batched transaction with batch size N, the total gas required from swap is reduced from N*x to just x.\nThe rollup is ""pessimistic"", it means that all the transactions are saved and applied on-chain.", ,"[""Solidity"",""TypeScript"",""Blockchain"",""Hardhat"",""Layer2""]","{""Category"":""science and research"",""average predictions"":0.245433}",science and research

Our concept enables the user to select the products they need to shop, wherein they also put up an estimated pickup time. This will be entered by the user during checkout, while also paying for the items purchased. This will help in preventing crowding at billing centres at such shops, which is needed to contain the spread of COVID-19. Vendors have also been adversely affected due to COVID with lockdown being imposed in the entire country, hampering their sales and their daily meals. Some have also suffered to earn bread for their family members. Our webapp provides the option to partner up with the store, wherein they can sell their products at our quoted price.

Easy-Meds,Our project mainly aims in promoting the usage of generic medicines from Jan Aushadhi Scheme by the Government of India and to reduce the Out-of-Pocket (OOP) expenses of Indian households.,https://devfolio.co/submissions/easymeds-69ad,"[""https://github.com/RagulRaj-S/Easy-meds"",""https://easy-meds108.herokuapp.com/""]","The problem Easy-Meds solves\nAs India is one of the highest per capita out-of-pocket expenditures’ country, such generics will save a lot of money which can be used for other health issues. In all countries, the use of generic drugs has increased significantly in recent years. In India, most people with high financial backgrounds always go for the prescribed branded drug. But it is a huge burden for the people in the middle class to spend on branded medicines. People can be benefitted from this website by knowing the equivalent substituent for the branded medicine they consume and the feedbacks received by the people consuming the same medicine. By knowing the equivalent substituent of the medicine they can consult with the doctor about whether they can use that medicine as it is cost-efficient. The consumers will trust the generic medicines by going through the feedbacks which are posted by people with the same health conditions. The people who are benefitted from generic medicines can post their feedback through this website, so other consumers who are hesitating to use these medicines will get aware. Generic medicines are typically 30% - 80% cheaper than originator equivalents. However, as the study shows, the price of some generic medicines available under JAS is costlier than the corresponding branded medicine available in the market. This suggests that the existing pricing of JAS would actually increase the OOP expenditure of patient households, which fails the purpose and objective of the scheme. For this problem, the prices of the medicine should be regularized. The prices of medicines that are relatively much cheaper than the branded medicines can be increased slightly. The profit obtained from increasing such medicines prices can be utilized to lower the generic medicine prices which are more than the branded medicines.", ,"[""JSON"",""Materialize CSS"",""React.js""]","{""Category"":""mental health"",""average predictions"":0.391022}",mental health

Industry association, Assocham, published in its study that forty two percent of working professionals in the Indian private sector suffer from depression, general anxiety. There could be many reasons for depression and mental health disorders.There is a high chance of depression in the employees due to change in lifestyle and work cultures. It definitely affects the performance of an individual employee. So many companies took the various initiatives to ease the workplace atmosphere.\nMany people are stressed due to rapid change in daily life routine, and work culture.Stress and mental health problems can be identified by a person’s behavior like how he/she feels, eats, thinks, works, walks etc over a period of observation. Work pressure, working environment, people we interact with, daily routine work, food habits, time spent on social media, daily exercise time, monthly income and expenses, consuming alcohol and tobacco, etc. are some of the major reasons behind building stress among the people. Stress can be detected through some conventional medical symptoms such as headache, rapid heartbeats, feeling low energy, chest pain, frequent colds, infections, etc. The stress also may reflect in normal behavior while carrying out day-to-day activities\nIn our project we consider eighteen parameters as inputs about the lifestyle and work culture of an individual. And using machine learning techniques we are predicting about the possibility of depression. Various machine learning techniques are applied for data cleaning, data balancing and to train the model.

For example, at the time of writing this, the Deposit APY for $DAI was about 10.75%, whereas the borrow APY is at 19.2% on Aave's markets.\nThese kinds of differences, while generated due to the pool logic, and totally fair, leave a lot of room for yearning better rates to both - the lender and the borrower. I wanted to find a way to close this gap and allow the lenders and the borrowers to come to a better rate between the markets' - a sort of a win-win situation, where the borrower can potentially get better (lower) rates and the lender gets a better bang for their buck (as they can negotiate a better rate than the markets).\nAdditionally, another issue that I wanted to solve was the ability of the users to provide a custom liquidation threshold. In traditional markets, these are fixed and decided by the app makers, or a DAO. This effectively restricts their risk appetite and handcuffs them to the ones provided by the pool. If someone with a lower risk appetite wants a lower liquidation threshold, they should be able to get that and adjust the reward (The APY) accordingly.\nHowever, it's not all sugar. Such a system, while encourages better rates to the parties, also might not be a good way to get immediate or large loans. In fact, your bid may never be fulfilled by a lender, leading you to edit your specs multiple times before you get a lender to help you out. Additionally, this system potentially restricts large orders, as you may not find a single lender to fill your demands. Both these problems are on our radar, and we have potential solutions for them both, none of which were yet implemented (more on those below)", ,"[""Solidity"",""Bootstrap"",""Flask"",""Python"",""Ethereum"",""Ganache"",""Truffle Suite"",""Web3js""]","{""Category"":""science and research"",""average predictions"":0.274873}",science and research

We have stocks of various crops. Currently seven different stocks i.e., wheat, paddy, soyabean, rajma, sugarcane, bajra and maize are available.\nAn year is divided in two seasons, one form January to June and other from July to December. Fresh stocks are available at the beginning of every season. Stocks quantity is fixed but the price varies with time and other factors affecting that particular crop production. Time tends to increase the price of the stocks and other factors may increase or decrease the price.\nThe money thus collected by the stocks are given as credit to the farmers at reasonavble rates for agricultural use.\nAt the end of season, farmers are to repay back their loans and users' stocks are reduced to zero and they are paid the price of the current value of their stocks. ( during the season, customer can sell their stocks at the current price).\nThus new season begins and the cycles continues again.\nwe have used Tezos to provide security to all the transactions. Since blockchains are highly secure so our system gives a very high level of security to the customers.\nAs the number of people investing in stocks are substantially high, it can be assumed that the financial stability will be present in he system.\nIt will be totally new for the Indian agriculture to get investments this huge in size and it can substantially increase the production and thus solve the issue of POVERTY, HUNGER and ECONOMIC GROWTH.", ,"[""HTML"",""CSS"",""JS"",""Django"",""Tezos"",""SmartPy"",""Pytezos""]","{""Category"":""general wellfare"",""average predictions"":0.336648}",general wellfare

India is toppping the charts for wrong reasons. The main reason for this is the inefficient way of surveillance and monitoring being used in our country. Several hundreds and thousands of CCTV cameras are being installed every day but only a select few have the monitoring access to them. The problem lies in the fact that inspecting several hundreds and thousands of videos is very laborous and time-intensive task.\nOnly after a crime is committed, hundreds and thousands of footages are inspected to find the crime scenes evidence.\nIs there a way to minimise this? What if the crime/violence is reported in realtime using technology.\nIn this project we try to explore this possibility. Introducing to you our project VISION.\nWe have devised a complete software solution for safety and surveillance where we convert the conventional CCTVs from an evidence collection to a crime prevention and detection tool to ensure safety and security. This real-time crime detection technology is integrated with security systems and Desktop Application to get push-in notifications in case any suspicious activity is discovered.\nOur solution captures and pre-processes the video feed and stores the frames of the video using OpenCV.

Cross Chain Streaming using Superfluid,A set of features built on top of the SuperFluid protocol to allow seamless cross-chain streaming and real-time asset conversion.,https://devfolio.co/submissions/cross-chain-streaming-using-superfluid-f418,"[""https://github.com/ankurdubey521/SuperFluid-Cross-Chain-Externsion""]","The problem Cross Chain Streaming using Superfluid solves\nWhat may happen is that a user may have some funds on a chain (say mainnet) and wished to interact with a DApp deployed on another chain (like polygon). In the case of SuperFluid streams, a conventional method would require the user to manually transfer the tokens from one chain to another using a Token Bridge, however, this is not ideal and defeats the purpose of gasless streams.\nThe project aims to solve this issue by utilizing Pools of SuperTokens deployed on various chains that would act as entry and exit points of cross-chain streams. This is done by starting a stream from an EOA to a Pool on the same chain, and then starting an equivalent stream on another from the chain's Pool to the EOA on that chain, effectively starting a cross-chain stream b/w the EOAs involved. This allows users to seamlessly start a SuperFluid stream from one chain to another without manually transferring the tokens to the second chain.\nThe use of token pools also allows real-time asset conversion, for example converting a stream of DAIx to an equivalent USDTx stream. This is done by starting a stream of DAIx to a Pool, and then starting an equivalent stream of USDTx back to the user from the pool, which the user is then free to use for their usecase. This is useful in situation where a DApp may only accept streams in a particular token, one which the user may not have at the moment.\nThe pools act as reserves of SuperTokens, and the liquidity is provided by LPs. LPs are incentivised to give their tokens to the Pool by paying them a fraction of all streams opened using the system, in proportion to the LP's contribution. (this is still in development).", ,"[""React.js"",""MaterialUI"",""Hardhat"",""Superfluid""]","{""Category"":""science and research"",""average predictions"":0.414185}",science and research

TAs are the true backend bookkeepers of ""who owns what stock.""\nHowever, millions of human-processed book-entry stock transfers waste billions of shareholder dollars each year. Furthermore, it oftentimes takes HOURS sitting on the phone to directly transfer book-entry stock, and, for this sub-par shareholder service, firms waste 6+ figures/yr (over 1.44B last year in the US alone) for a trusted central point of failure. The whole process in general is slow, tedious, wasteful, and incredibly lucrative, as the central bookkeeping trust creates one of the highest-margin businesses in all of public finance.\nThe role of transfer agents today represents a gross misallocation of shareholder dollars that must be haulted. Blockchain was created for the sole purpose of maintaining ledgers just like a TA ledger, and smart contracts (and our subsequent dApp) enable intelligent execution of a decentralized finance TA protocol. This means that anyone can access and transfer their assets instantaneously, prove their ownership stake with no central trust, verify other shareholder stakes, vote at shareholder meetings without proxy middlemen, and more with no central point of failure... all while significantly lowering the TA expense for the underlying since cost comes from distributed gas fees (not arbitrary agent profit).\nWe came into the hackathon with a general outline of how we wanted our smart contracts to function, and finished it strong with a seamless Web3 interface for stock transfer agent services. Through equity backed by contractual transfer agent obligations with the underlying, we've laid out the groundwork for global decentralized equities.", ,"[""Solidity"",""IPFS"",""MetaMask"",""npm"",""Web3"",""Smart Contracts"",""Truffle"",""Ether"",""LaTeX"",""solc""]","{""Category"":""science and research"",""average predictions"":0.305085}",science and research

So, our idea is to retrieve the products when scrolling stops, get similar products to that using ML techniques and display that at their point of scroll. We can aslo display ads instead of recommendations.\nTo track the user’s scroll behavior, we use Javascript. The JavaScript detects the scrolling activity. It also creates a div with an id which is used to display the data present on the screen.

NFTProject,Passive income from NFTs as collateral,https://devfolio.co/submissions/nftproject-d942,"[""https://github.com/sebastiantf/nftproject""]","The problem NFTProject solves\nNFTProject (for the lack of a better name) is a peer-to-peer marketplace that allows generating yield from idle NFTs. Holders can put up their NFTs as collateral and lenders with access to liquidity can offer capital against these collateral NFTs. The capital thus raised will be used in promising (automated) yield generation strategies across DeFi. The yield thus generated will be distributed between the participants. There are several NFTs already available in the market with their value constantly going up. There are several collectors who buy these NFTs at very high prices. But once a collector acquires an NFT, there isn't much value generated from it, while sitting around idle inside their wallets. These NFTs can generate returns for the collector only in its next sale, and that too by having to cede ownership. This project aims to help collectors use their idle NFTs to generate passive income, without giving up their ownership. For lenders who are looking for high yield investment opportunities in DeFi, they can invest in such strategies with less effort (automated), while hedging the risk of being liquidated which they would've had to bear, had they invested in these strategies directly. NFT holders can list their NFTs in the marketplace as open for offers from lenders. Lenders checking the marketplace for listed NFTs can then see the NFT and make offers. Once the NFT holder and lender reach a consensus around the offer and the yield generation strategy, the NFT along with the funds offered by the lender will be transferred to the protocol's escrow contract. The capital offered by the lender will be invested in one of the high risk, even leveraged yield generation strategies across DeFi, by the protocol. The protocol would then keep accruing yield from these strategies.

The portal also provides the opportunities to share resources like previous year question papers, reference guides, etc which will be a great help for the upcoming batches. Also, a daily calendar is present which lists all the important events happening on that particular day.\nHostel-related: Students face a lot of issue with hostel facilities and they lack a proper platform to raise their issues so to solve that issue we have a created a platform to raise issues which will be visible to all the students and hostel warden.

Get It Right,Bend it the right way!,https://devfolio.co/submissions/get-it-right-2e96,"[""https://github.com/Pratye/Get-It-Right""]","The problem Get It Right solves\nThe past year has been difficult for the entire world in many spheres, be it personal or professional. But the most prominent issue was maintaining our health and lifestyles. We resorted to various forms of home-workouts, which sadly had more adverse consequences than positive results. This was mainly due to insufficient knowledge of warmups and postures, which resulted in performing the exercise wrong. The sudden surge of heavy-duty positions made our bodies dangerously sore and we would wonder if we had accidentally nicked an artery or burst a blood vessel. Keeping this in mind, we have developed a model which can help us assess our excercise postures using Posenet app extension and Mobile net Deep learning model. The app uses video recognition technology to assess the postures and provide us results. The was constructed using the MIT's Personal Image Classifier and the app was constructed over MIT App inventor.",2nd,"[""Machine Learning"",""Deep Learning"",""MIT App Inventor"",""Google Firebase"",""MIT Personal image classifier"",""Mobile net"",""Posenet app extension""]","{""Category"":""mental health"",""average predictions"":0.174962}",mental health

Thus creating a secure testing environment will benefit the teachers as well as students.\nGovernment Organisations- Government organisations are like universities and NTA, as we observed during the pandemic trust offline mode more than the online examination as security is a foremost issue during such exams. But our tools would ensure the maximum safety to all the users.\nMNCs- MNCs also can take interviews on the tool to increase their reach to maximum talented people and trusting their talent due to the secure environment offered by the tool.\nOur tool can be used by any range of people who aim to conduct a secure examination and that to with minimum work at their end.\nHOW OUR APPLICATION WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS\n1.Student will able to login only when his/her face will be match by the photographs uploaded by exam authority i.e this will act as face lock.\n2.Whenever student will try to exit full screen without submitting answers then they will be automatically get log out and act as cheated.\n3.We have implemented other securities apart from face detection so that in any case if face goes undetected or there is low network bandwidth a secure enviornment does not get compromised.(We have disabled few keyboard keys like ctrl, shift and right click.)\n4.Teacher can upload question even before one month and exam will only start at given time.\n5.No invigilator is required because our backend will handle this.\n6.Results will be automatically get calculated by our application.", ,"[""Bootstrap"",""JavaScript"",""OpenCV"",""Python"",""CSS3"",""HTML5""]","{""Category"":""education"",""average predictions"":0.230374}",education
Project Athena,Simulation of a level 3 autonomous vehicle,https://devfolio.co/submissions/project-athena-0ecc,"[""https://github.com/Boolean-Bandits/Project_Athena""]","The problem Project Athena solves\nThe multiple problems which this project solves are:\nREDUCED ACCIDENTS\nAccording to the USDOT website: ""With 94 percent of fatal vehicle crashes attributable to human error, the potential of autonomous vehicle technologies to reduce deaths and injuries on our roads urges us to action.""\nSelf-driving cars are projected to reduce traffic deaths by 90 percent, saving 30,000 lives a year\nREDUCED CO2 EMISSIONS\nThe reduction in congestion will most likely result in a reduction of CO2 emissions as well.\nSince the software will drive the car, the modern vehicle can now be programmed to reduce emissions to the maximum extent possible. The transition to new-age cars is expected to contribute to a 60% fall in emissions.\nREDUCED TRAFFIC CONGESTION\nAmericans currently spend more than 6.9 billion hours a year sitting in traffic, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. Even decreasing the number of accidents could reduce congestion, because up to 25% of congestion is caused by traffic incidents,\nUnder normal circumstances, human drivers naturally create stop-and-go traffic, even in the absence of bottlenecks, lane changes, merges, or other disruptions. This phenomenon is called the ""phantom traffic jam."" U of Illinois researchers found that by controlling the pace of the autonomous car in the study, they were able to smooth out the traffic flow for all the cars.\nINCREASED LANE CAPACITY\nResearch from the State Smart Transportation Initiative (SSTI) shows potential for autonomous vehicles could increase highway capacity by 100 percent and increase expressway travel speeds by more than 20 percent.\nLOWER FUEL CONSUMPTION\nAV technology can improve fuel economy, improving it by 4–10 percent by accelerating and decelerating more smoothly than a human driver. Further improvements could be had by reducing the distance between vehicles and increasing roadway capacity.", ,"[""rviz"",""ROS (Robot Operating System)"",""roscpp"",""rospy""]","{""Category"":""general wellfare"",""average predictions"":0.393229}",general wellfare
